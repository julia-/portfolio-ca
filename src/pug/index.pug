          p.intro-paragraph I am a developer. I love working in front-end development but also get a kick out of back-end development.
          p I’m naturally inquisitive and enjoy figuring out how things work. I have a defined sense of aesthetic and enjoy making thoughtful, engaging, and functional web applications that have a simple, clean and distinct design. I also have an eye for detail so I'll spot that missing parenthesis!
          p I’ve built web applications using Ruby on Rails and have a strong foundation in web design and development. I am currently attending Coder Academy’s web development bootcamp.
          p Before moving into development, I worked in the Library and Information Management sector, where I produced and managed content.
          p When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with friends, family and my two cats, Willow and Orlando, and listening to music and podcasts, and going to gigs and exhibitions.
