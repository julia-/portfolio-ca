# Portfolio

Demonstrate to prospective employers and other developers my coding experience and to showcase my projects.

## Design & Planning

My goal was to design and build a portfolio that stood out and was rememberable but still simple and minimal in design.

### Ideation
Before defining a concept for my portfolio, I explored portfolios from developers, designers and creative agencies.

I also created a [mood board](http://pin.it/rm5GGe5) in Pinterest to collect illustrations, designs, colours swatches, and typography examples to gain inspiration for my own portfolio.

I was then able to start developing potential designs for my portfolio.

### Design
My chosen design was heavily inspired by minimalism and punk/new wave-influenced graphic design. What I am aiming to capture is a sense of clarity and contrast, as well as bold, clean lines. 

My colour palette consists of French Lilac and Mine shaft. In choosing these colours, I was looking for either bright, neon colours or more muted, pastel colours to offset the starkness of the dark grey.

I feel that the choice of French Lilac  gives enough brightness and contrast, while also providing a dramatic effect. From an accessibility perspective, this colour palette is also suitable for people with colour visibility problems.

My font choice of Big John and Montserrat [â€¦]

## Development
### Tasks
- [x] `git init`
- [x] Create repo
- [x] Set up folder and file structure
- [x] Grunt - conifgure tasks
- [x] Extra small view (mobile)
- [ ] Small view (mobile)
- [x] Medium view (tablet)
- [x] Large view (laptop)
- [ ] Extra large view (desktop)
- [x] Responsive images
- [x] Navigation
- [x] Gallery
- [ ] Gallery fullscreen overlay
- [ ] Single page app (react)


I used [Pug](https://pugjs.org) and [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) and used [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) to compile the Pug and Stylus files and to perform other tasks including generating responsive images.

## Challenges and final thoughts
### Images
- Displaying images without taking away from design
- image layout

### Colour scheme
- restrictive colour scheme

### Navigation
- single page app

### Compatibility and display
- breakpoints
